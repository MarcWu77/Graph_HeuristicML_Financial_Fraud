Scenario
  I synthesized a set of toy fraud transactions data. For example, a typical "fradulent cash-out" goes like that accounts may pretend to consume in a certain merchant by credit card and then the merchant returns the money back to the account. Here, the account dishonestly obtains a batch of "dirty money".Sometimes, smarter customer may cooperate with others in a complex network. Thus, it is harder and harder to detect such fraud transaction if merely counting on human or risk experts. 
  The bank, hence, calls for a half-automatical or automatical model to capture the fraudulent transactions OR accounts.
  
Your Tasks
  1. help the bank visualize the directed weighted transaction network [edge list = 'from_id','to_id','amt'(weight)], 
      where 1) account and merchant have different colors, 
            2) nodes size varies along with to their degree centrality, 
            3) edges width varies based on the transaction amount and 4) the network layout should be set as 'spring' style. 
     Plus, you may need extrat efforts to beautify the final network.
  2. try using QAP and ERGM to predict the fraud transactions. Dig out potential factors that may influence the fraudulent behaviors.

Data Schema Information
  1.Credit card transaction record (toy_fraud.csv):                  
    "event_id" ->   transaction order             
    "from_id"  ->   transaction sender ID      
    "to_id" ->      transaction receiver ID  
    "amt" ->        transaction amount 
    "event_type" -> transaction type (pay/cashout/transfer/repay)    
    "from_type" ->  sender type (acct/merchant, only 2)      
    "to_type"  ->   receiver type(acct/merchant, only 2) 
    "from_fraud" -> sender annotated as fraud before
    "to_fraud" ->   receiver annotated as fraud before 
    "txn_time" ->   transaction time 
    "isFraud"  ->   transaction annotated as fraud
  2.Account attributes (toy_nodes.csv):
    "node_id" -> sender or receiver's ID
    "node_type" -> acct or merchant, only 2
    "node_fraud" -> sender or receiver aer annotated as "fraud" before
    "overdue_last_1M" -> sender or reveiver's overdue (another kind of dishonest behavior) counts in last one month
    "overdue_last_3M" -> sender or reveiver's overdue counts in last three months
    "risk_pref_invest" -> the preference of taking risky investment (scale = 1~10, evaluated by the bank)
